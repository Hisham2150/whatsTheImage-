What's The Image!

Used swift to create an iPad game, where an image  pops up on the screen and the player has to spell the image name correctly. The objective of the game is to get a high score and spell as many words correctly as you can. The player has five tries at spelling the word correctly before they get the word incorrect and move on to the next picture. This continues until you have reached the end where you see your total score of words guessed correctly and words guessed incorrectly.
